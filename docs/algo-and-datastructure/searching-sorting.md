Interpolation search vs Binary search
Stability in sorting algorithms
When does the worst case of Quicksort occur?
Lower bound for comparison based sorting algorithms
Which sorting algorithm makes minimum number of memory writes?
Find the Minimum length Unsorted Subarray, sorting which makes the complete array sorted
Merge Sort for Linked Lists
Sort a nearly sorted (or K sorted) array
Iterative Quick Sort
QuickSort on Singly Linked List
QuickSort on Doubly Linked List
Find k closest elements to a given value
Sort n numbers in range from 0 to n^2 – 1 in linear time
A Problem in Many Binary Search Implementations
Search in an almost sorted array
Sort an array in wave form
Why is Binary Search preferred over Ternary Search?
K’th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array
K’th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array in Expected Linear Time
K’th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array in Worst Case Linear Time
Find the closest pair from two sorted arrays
Find common elements in three sorted arrays
Given a sorted array and a number x, find the pair in array whose sum is closest to x
Count 1’s in a sorted binary array
Binary Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort for Singly Linked List
Why Quick Sort preferred for Arrays and Merge Sort for Linked Lists?
Merge Sort for Doubly Linked List
Minimum adjacent swaps to move maximum and minimum to corners

### What is a Promise?

A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.

The syntax of promise would be as below:
```javascript
const promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // promise description
})
```

### What are the states of promise?
Promises have three states:
1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that specified operation was completed.
3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

### What is a callback hell?
Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,
```javascript
async1(function(){
    async2(function(){
        async3(function(){
            async4(function(){
                ....
            });
        });
    });
});
```

### What are the different role in scrum?

The three scrum roles:

- **Product owner** – A product owner is actually the stakeholder of the project. He represents the project requirements before the team. He is responsible to have a vision of what to build and convey his detailed vision to the team. He is the starting point of an agile scrum software development project.

- **Scrum team**  – Scrum team is formed by the collective contribution of individuals who perform for the accomplishment of a particular project. The team is bound to work for the timely delivery of the requested product.

- **Scrum master** – Scrum master is the leader and the coach for the scrum team who checks whether the scrum team is executing committed tasks properly. He is also responsible to increase the efficiency and productivity of the team so that they can achieve the sprint goal effectively.

### What are the responsibilities of a Scrum Master?

Key responsibilities of a Scrum Master involves:

- Tracking and monitoring
- Understanding requirements properly
- Work to reach the project goal
- Process checking master and quality master
- Protect the team from detachments
- Improving the performance of the team
- Lead the meetings and resolve issues
- Resolution of conflicts and impediments
- Communication and reporting


### What are the ceremonies you perform in scrum

There are 3 major ceremonies performed in Scrum:-

- **Planning Meeting** – Where the entire scrum teams along with the scrum master and product owner meets and discuss each item from the product backlog that they can work on the sprint. When the story is estimated and is well understood by the team, the story then moves into the Sprint Backlog.
- **Review Meeting** – Where the scrum team demonstrates their work done to the stake holders
- **Retrospective meeting** – Where the scrum teams along with the scrum master and product owner meets and retrospect the last sprint they worked on. They majorly discuss about 3 things:

What went well?

What could be done better?

Action Items

Apart from these three ceremonies, we have one more called “Backlog grooming” meeting. In this meeting, the scrum team along with the scrum master and product owner. The product owner put forward the business requirements as per the priority and the team discussed over it, identifies the complexity, dependencies and efforts. The team may also do the story pointing at this stage.

### What are the different artifacts in scrum?

There are two artifacts maintained in Scrum:

- **Product Backlog** – Containing the prioritized list of business requirements
- **Sprint Backlog** – Contains the user stories to be done by the scrum team for a sprint.

### How do you measure the work done in a sprint?

It’s measured by Velocity.

### What is Velocity?

Velocity is the sum of story points that a scrum team completes (meets the definition of done) over a sprint.

### How do you create the burn down chart?

Burn down chart is a graph which shows the estimated v/s actual effort of the scrum tasks.

It is a tracking mechanism by which for a particular sprint; day to day tasks are tracked to check whether the stories are progressing towards the completion of the committed story points or not. Here we should remember that the efforts are measured in terms of user stories and not hours.

### What do you do in a sprint review and retrospective?
    
During Sprint review we walkthrough and demonstrate the feature or story implemented by the scrum team to the stake holders.
    
During retrospective, we try to identify in a collaborative way what went well, what could be done better and action items to have continuous improvement.

###  What is DoD? How is this achieved?
    
DoD stands for Definition of done. It is achieved when

the story is development complete,
QA complete,
The story meets and satisfy the acceptance criteria
regression around the story is complete
The feature is eligible to be shipped / deployed in production


### What is MVP in scrum?

A Minimum Viable Product is a product which has just the bare minimum required feature which can be demonstrated to the stakeholders and is eligible to be shipped to production.

### What are Epics?

Epics are equivocal user stories or we can say these are the user stories which are not defined and are kept for future sprints.

### How do you calculate a story point?

A Story point is calculated by taking into the consideration the development effort+ testing effort + resolving dependencies and other factors that would require to complete a story.

### Is it possible that you come across different story point for development and testing efforts? In that case how do you resolve this conflict?

Yes, this is a very common scenario. There may be a chance that the story point given by the development team is, say 3 but the tester gives it 5. In that case both the developer and tester have to justify their story point, have discussion in the meeting and collaborate to conclude a common story point.

### You are in the middle of a sprint and suddenly the product owner comes with a new requirement, what will you do?

In ideal case, the requirement becomes a story and moves to the backlog. Then based on the priority, team can take it up in the next sprint. But if the priority of the requirement is really high, then the team will have to accommodate it in the sprint but it has to very well communicated to the stakeholder that incorporating a story in the middle of the sprint may result in spilling over few stories to the next sprint.

### In case you receive a story at the last day of the sprint to test and you find there are defects, what will you do? Will you mark the story to done?

A story is done only when it is development complete + QA complete + acceptance criteria is met + it is eligible to be shipped into production. In this case if there are defects, the story is partially done and not completely done, so I will spill it over to next sprint.

### How do you create the burn down chart?

Burn down chart is a graph which shows the estimated v/s actual effort of the scrum tasks.

It is a tracking mechanism by which for a particular sprint; day to day tasks are tracked to check whether the stories are progressing towards the completion of the committed story points or not. Here we should remember that the efforts are measured in terms of user stories and not hours.

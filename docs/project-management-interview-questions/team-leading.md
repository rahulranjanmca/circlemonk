### How do you motivate your team?
One of the way you need to make aware of the team, that as you work, you get knowledge and that is the best thing you can take it from here, beside getting salary.

And then we can have some awards like
- Employee of the Month
- Organizing Fun Events 
- Allowing staff to occasionally leave early when work is not done, so that they wont feel bad when work is there, and they have to stay longer.

### How would you mitigate a dispute between two team members who disagree over their responsibilities?

Listen to both side carefully and then come to judgement.
